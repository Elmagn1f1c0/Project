My design decision is layered architecture or n-tier architecture which allows my model to talk to my repository, the repository will talk to the service and the service will talk to the controller.
In my unit test, I made use of Xunit test because of Parameterized Tests, Rich Ecosystem, Better Test Parallelization, simplicity etc.
